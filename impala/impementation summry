    create buffer_queue : trajectory , input shape ,output size , queue_size , batch_size , number_actors

3. start the training of the learner have to dig deep we must be able to use the existing code
    for this we have to include train function which can implemented by refering to the model.train amd using the our own trainer.py

4. Actor part.
